# Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project,
please do not hesitate to contact us.
We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to fix the problem.

## White-Hat Program
Individuals who find severe security vulnerabilities within this application
may be eligible for a reward.

Rewards:
| Vulnerability Type       | Reward                              |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Log-In Vulnerability     | $7,302                              |

| Remote code execution    | $2                                  |

## Legal Note
We are unable to issue rewards to individuals who are on sanctions lists, or 
who are in countries (e.g. Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria) on sanctions lists.
You are responsible for any tax implications depending on your country of residency and 
citizenship. There may be additional restrictions on your ability to enter depending upon 
your local law.

This is not a competition, but rather an experimental and discretionary rewards 
program. You should understand that we can cancel the program at any time and the
decision as to whether or not to pay a reward has to be entirely at our discretion.

Of course, your testing must not violate any law, or disrupt or compromise 
any data that is not your own.

###### Team Jacketing reserves the right to withhold White-Hat rewards indefinitely for any reason without notice.
